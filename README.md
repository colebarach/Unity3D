# Unity3D
A public collection of assets and packages for the Unity 3D game engine

This repository acts as a means of managing and organizing a collection of packages for unity. The packages are all located in the Assets directory and possess individual README files. For use with a local unity project, download the .unitypackage file of the appropriate package and version number, and install it to your project. This repository will be updated with time, and currently is a framework for a large project.
