# Pathfinding
A collection of pathfinding algorithms implemented in C#. Each algorithm is implemented through a main library file, which contains frontend functions for library usage.
## A* Algorithm
The A* pathfinding algorithm, referred to as AStar in source, can be read about here: https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=A-star_algorithm
The implementation of this algorithm uses a 2D texture of white and black pixels to indicate open and obstructed areas of a path.
