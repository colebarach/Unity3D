# Pathfinding
A collection of pathfinding algorithms implemented in C#. Each algorithm is implemented through a main library file, which contains a variety of functions related to said algorithm.
## A* Algorithm
The A* pathfinding algorithm, referred to as AStar in source, can be read about here: https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=A-star_algorithm
The implementation of this algorithm uses a 2D texture of white and black pixels to indicate open and obstructed areas of a path.
**Documentation on this implementation is limited, as it is planned to be reworked at a future date : 9/16/22**
